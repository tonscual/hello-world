# hello-world
This is my first repository in GitHub using the hello-world guide.
I am adding a change to the readme file in a branch.
I have not seen the Markdown info, but I'll do it now so the next lines will contain something of it. Stay tuned.
#This is supposed to be a header.
## This is also a header.
### And this is a header too. 
** I really don't know why the two previous headers are bold (this line should be bold and I don't see any bold character here **
*italic, I see this is italic*
***is there something bold and italic? yes, it is***
##I did something wrong with lines 6, 7 and 8, I believe I used a shortcut with the keyboard (a ctrl, cmd or alt combination) without noticing.
**trying bold again**
I was going to use an emoji, obviously 😂

Ok, I'm done. For now.
